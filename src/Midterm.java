/*
Keyword to call different constructor in same class: 
this()

Private instance attributes modified by public (or protected) methods is known as:
encapsulation

Throw sends an exception back to the caller

Protected gives visibility to the class, package, and subclass, but not the world.

Reference of the object is passed when invoking a method with an object argument.

A class can implement multiple interfaces.

A constructor is invoked to create an object instance.

break; is necessary to make switch statements work.

variable x  = (condition)?true:false

Overloading: Using the same method name with a different parameter list.

Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and must be inherited. They do not need to contain abstract methods.

Final keyword keeps variables and methods from being changed.

Subclasses inherit protected and public methods from the superclass.

Override methods by changing implementation of a method defined in a superclass

@override notation is not necessary to override methods, but is very helpful.

A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces.

Classes can only inherit one class at a time.

Interfaces can extend other interfaces.

Abstract classes must be fully implemented by their concrete subclasses.

Classes cannot restrict visibility of methods by overriding them.

Every core java class inherits the object class.

To call the first constructor in the second, call it in the second and use this(arg)

***For each = for(String value:values)***

super keyword: 
calls a constructor in the superclass, 
calls a visible method in the superclass,
references a visible attribute in the superclass.

@Test is required for JUnit test methods.

Parameter list in method header, and arguments in method call must agree in number, type, and order.

Classes consist of: name, methods and attributes

Two types of methods:
function(input & output) & procedure(does not return anything)

A double can hold 2^64 bits.

Bytes take less memory, but only use if you know the value is between -127 and 128.

@functions talk to the compiler.

Italicized methods are static.

Curly brackets used for block statements.

Always use getters & setters if you have private attributes.

Classes must be abstract to have abstract methods. 

Abstract classes cannot be instantiated.

private > protected > default > public

Override in a subclass

final class cannot be extended.

break ends everything, continue skips to the next iteration.

***wrapper class***
